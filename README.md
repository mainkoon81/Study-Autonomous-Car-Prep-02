### Intro to C++

Let's see "9 + 5"
```
// include all libraries needed
#include <iostream>

/* 	
*	These are C++ comments. There are two ways to write comments in C++.
*	Using the slash with an asterisk is one way.
*/ 

// Here is another way to write comments in C++

/* In general, C++ code is run from a file called main.cpp
* The implementation goes into a function called main().
* The main() function almost always returns a zero, which provides evidence that the program ran to its end.
*/

// define main function
int main() {
    int integer_one;
    integer_one = 5;
    // Define a variable called integer_two and assign a value of 9.
    int integer_two;
    integer_two = 9;
    // Calculate the sum of integer_one and integer_two and assign the result to integer_sum
    int integer_sum;
    integer_sum = integer_one + integer_two;
    // outputs the results to standard out
    std::cout << integer_sum;
    return 0;
}
```
